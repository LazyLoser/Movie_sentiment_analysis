This Jupyter Notebook aims to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews by building a binary classification model using the Bag of Words technique. The model will predict whether a given movie review expresses positive or negative sentiment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of movie reviews labeled with sentiment (positive or negative). Each review is preprocessed and represented as a bag of words, where each word represents a feature.

The dataset is split into two subsets: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the Jupyter Notebook:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- nltk
- re

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to keep the project dependencies isolated.

## Project Structure

The project structure consists of a single Jupyter Notebook file:

```
movie_sentiment_analysis.ipynb
README.md
```

- `movie_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` is the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `README.md` provides information about the project and instructions for running it.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie_sentiment_analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie_sentiment_analysis
   ```

3. Activate your virtual environment (if used) and launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `movie_sentiment_analysis.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

5. Follow the instructions and execute the cells in the notebook step by step to preprocess the data, train the sentiment classification model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new movie reviews.

6. Modify the notebook as needed to suit your specific requirements.
